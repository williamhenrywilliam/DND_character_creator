# DND_character_creator
Welcome to the Character Creator for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons! 

This command line program walks a user through a (simplified) character creation process that includes:
-Selecting your Class
-Selecting your Fantasy Race
-Selecting your Name
-Rolling your Ability scores

Once completed, the program creates a "character sheet" (a .txt file) with all of user's character info.

This program utilizes a community hosted api for D&D5e which can be found at www.dnd5eapi.co

Currently, all happy paths are working as intended. I am still working on smoothing out certain edge cases.
